# Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics & Statistics

[//]: ## (Outline features)
COMPAS is a publicly available rapid binary population synthesis code (https://compas.science/) that is designed so that evolution prescriptions and model parameters are easily 
adjustable.  COMPAS draws properties for a binary star system from a set of initial distributions, and evolves it from zero-age main sequence to the end of its life as two compact 
remnants.  It has been used for inference from observations of gravitational-wave mergers, Galactic neutron stars, X-ray binaries, and luminous red novae.

## Contact
Please email your queries to compas-user@googlegroups.com. You are also welcome to join the [COMPAS User Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!members/compas-user) to engage in discussions with COMPAS users and developers.

## Acknowledgements
If you use this code or parts of this code for results presented in a scientific publication, we would greatly appreciate if you send us your paper reference and make your input settings and output data publicly available by uploading it to the [COMPAS Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/compas/). Please also kindly include citations to our COMPAS methods paper https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210910352T/abstract. As the public COMPAS code is a product of work by the entire COMPAS collaboration over many years, we kindly request that, in recognition of this team effort, the paper is cited as “Team COMPAS: J. Riley et al.”. An example bibtex code is:

Note that the preferred acknowledgement relies on \noopsort and cites the paper as TEAM COMPAS; Riley et al.; to make it work, you'll have to include the following line at the start of your bibtex file:
@PREAMBLE{ {\providecommand{\noopsort}[1]{}} }

and change the author line in the bib entry to:

author = {{\noopsort{Team COMPAS}}{Team COMPAS: Riley, J.} and {Agrawal}, Poojan and {Barrett}, Jim W. and {Boyett}, Kristan N.~K. and {Broekgaarden}, Floor S. and {Chattopadhyay}, Debatri and {Gaebel}, Sebastian M. and {Gittins}, Fabian and {Hirai}, Ryosuke and {Howitt}, George and {Justham}, Stephen and {Khandelwal}, Lokesh and {Kummer}, Floris and {Lau}, Mike Y.~M. and {Mandel}, Ilya and {de Mink}, Selma E. and {Neijssel}, Coenraad and {Riley}, Tim and {van Son}, Lieke and {Stevenson}, Simon and {Vigna-Gomez}, Alejandro and {Vinciguerra}, Serena and {Wagg}, Tom and {Willcox}, Reinhold}
